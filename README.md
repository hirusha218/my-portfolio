### Quick tweaks I can do for you if you want

• Add your **Vercel or GitHub Pages URL**  
• Add **screenshots** of homepage, projects page, etc.  
• Add **badge icons** like visitors count, technologies  
• Add **Skills section with icons**  
• Add **hero banner** or profile photo

If you drop your **live link** and **repo name**, I’ll update those parts and give you the final polished version to paste directly into GitHub ✅
```
